## initialized.

@INCLUDE = Doxyfile

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = ooRexx

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.
#
# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is
# run.

EXCLUDE                = $(builder_src_dir)/extensions/platform/windows/ole \
                         $(builder_src_dir)/extensions/platform/windows/oodialog

# The EXCLUDE_SYMLINKS tag can be used to select whether or not files or
# directories that are symbolic links (a Unix file system feature) are excluded
# from the input.
# The default value is: NO.

EXCLUDE_SYMLINKS       = YES
